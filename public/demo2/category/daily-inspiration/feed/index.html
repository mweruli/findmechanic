When you slow down in traffic, stop at a red light, or must maneuver a quick hard stop because of an obstruction in the road your brakes are at work. Over time the use of your brakes causes normal wear and tear, which can render them ineffective or useless. It’s important to have regular maintenance performed on your braking system to keep it in tip top shape, and provide safe driving conditions for you and your family.</p>	</div>

<p>The brake system in your vehicle is comprised of a disc, also called a rotor, a caliper, and the brake pad. From inside the car, it seems like all that happens is a push on the brake pedal, and the vehicle stops. But inside the car, this depressed pedal sends brake fluid through the brake lines as a piston moves in the master cylinder. As pistons in the caliper are initiated, the brake shoe pushes against the rotor, causing friction on the brake drum. Essentially, this pressure caused by your brake pad on the drum will slow the roll of your vehicle, and eventually cause it to stop.</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, the friction of your brakes causes your brake pads to wear down over time, and they will need to be replaced time and time again. This is a normal part of the preventative maintenance routine you should include with your braking system.</p>

<p>Of course, this means spending some money to keep your vehicle in working order and get you home safely every day. So how much money are you looking at spending for brake repair?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>If something goes wrong with your car and you don&#8217;t know much about car repair, then it&#8217;s time to go to the shop and find out what&#8217;s wrong. However, lots of people are understandably worried about getting ripped off—mechanics are pretty good at detecting when a customer doesn&#8217;t know anything about cars. To avoid this, it&#8217;s a good idea to narrow down the possibilities of what&#8217;s going on inside your car.</p>
<p>The warning lights on your dashboard are the most obvious starting point. Yet the most common, the Check Engine light, can be utterly confusing because it can cover problems ranging widely in severity. Others, like the engine temperature light, tire pressure light, or oil light are more straightforward to decipher. Regardless of what lights up, never ignore it. Delaying a diagnosis and repair could lead to even bigger problems down the road.</p></blockquote>

Your front-drive car has excellent all-season tires and ABS (antilock braking system)—although the ABS light has been on since you banzai&#8217;d the berm at the end of the driveway an hour ago.
