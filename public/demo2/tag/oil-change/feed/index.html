										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don&#8217;t need to spend a fortune on aftermarket installations to upgrade your car&#8217;s amenities. We&#8217;ve rounded up the best deals on gear for a safer, smarter, and cleaner commute.</p>
<p><span id="more-560"></span>Over the river and through the woods was more dangerous back when cars had crummy bias-ply tires, rear-wheel drive and ordinary brakes. So, tonight you feel confident driving home through several inches of freshly fallen snow after a sumptuous holiday dinner. Your front-drive car has excellent all-season tires and ABS (antilock braking system)—although the ABS light has been on since you banzai&#8217;d the berm at the end of the driveway an hour ago. This may explain the loss of steering control when you&#8217;re slowing down for a corner. Like this downhill turn, right &#8230; there, as you blow straight past it with the wheels skidding and the steering cranked over hard against the stop</p>
<blockquote><p>ABS has become pretty much standard equipment on most vehicles. Sensors tell a computer when a wheel stops rotating, which indicates—at least when the vehicle still has forward speed—that the brakes have overpowered the available traction at that particular wheel. The computer then directs a hydraulic valve to release some brake fluid pressure to the wheel to let it rotate again.</p></blockquote>
<p>This process repeats many times per second until the vehicle stops or you lift your foot off the brake pedal. The ABS computer does a power-on self test every time you cycle the ignition. If it finds it&#8217;s lacking data, or a hydraulic pump or valve isn&#8217;t responding, it illuminates the ABS warning light on the dash.</p>
